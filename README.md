# CLI RPN Calculator
### Assessment test

```
This is console based solution implemented using stack data structure.

The reason to chosen stack because it is linear data structure in which it insert and delete element from only one side.
```

```
Improvement points for future :
1. It can be extended this solution for in prefix and infix polish notation as well
2. It can be added with brackets, mod i.e % etc.
```

```
If want to integrate this solution in existing application then just need to create object of RPNCalculator class  which is implements Calculator interface, and call calculator method
```

```
To run this code
>  php RPNCalculator.php
```
